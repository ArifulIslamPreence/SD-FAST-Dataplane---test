Current working operation:

Sending packets to primary and backup route according to the tag status.

Topology : Toplogy consist of 6 switches and two hosts connected to s1 and s4. The nodes are configured in topology.json file. A picture of the topology is attached.

Testing Primary path : h1-->s1-->s2-->s3-->s4--> h2 
Testing Backup path : h1 --> s1 --> s2 --> s5 --> s6 --> s4 --> h2

Run: 
1. p4 terminal --> Vagrant init, vagrant up
2. make run --> it should do the following : 
   * build the topology in mininet and configure the switch. A mininet terminal will open.

3. open two host. 
   mininet > xterm h1 h2
4. need to start the server at h2 --> ./receive.py 
5. test the primary forwarding, 
   h1 --> ./send.py 10.0.2.2 "test primary" --T 1 (the tag is T1, meaning regular tag packet)
   print the primary route : 1-2-3-4 
6.test the backup forwarding, 
  h1 --> ./send.py 10.0.2.2 "test backup" --T 2 (the tag is T2, meaning crankback/recovered tag packet)
  print the backup route 1-2-5-6-4
